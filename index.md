### Introduction
Le Sirenuse Positano is a luxury 5 star hotel located in Positano, on the Amalfi Coast. Right in front of the hotel, in the Emporio Sirenuse store, tourists and guests can find a collection of dresses and swimwear perfectly aligned with the Mediterranean style of the hotel. The collection, curated by the hotel owner Mrs. Carla Sersale, is also sold online on a dedicated website and on different others online channels. Both the hotel and the store have an official Instagram account, the first one having a much bigger influence with respect to the one of the store. In this setting we were asked to find a way to improve the online presence of the clothing brand by leveraging social media platforms; while protecting its
heritage, we wanted to enhance the popularity of the
fashion brand independently.
### Project Scope and Outline
In order to improve the social media presence of the brand and produce relevant insights for the brand managers we decided that we needed to intervene on two fronts: we would need to identify and characterize communities of users among the followers of the brand and its competitors; given that information we would need to allow the brand to post relevant content for the communities it decided to target, by giving them a metric of relevance.

In order to accomplish those two goals we thought of a complete pipeline that would incorporate two phases: the first phase would detect communities of users based on their content (pictures and captions); the second one instead, given a set of pictures that the user would like to post, would rank those pictures based on a target community chosen by the user among the ones found during the first phase.
