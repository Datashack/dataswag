Dear Mrs. Sersale, 


I hope you've been well since our last meeting in March. I’m writing today to provide a quick update on the progress of our work since our meeting in Milan. 


Our team has completed the analysis of Le Sirenuse’s digital ecosystem, and we are now refining the tool's pipeline to maximize its potential impact for the Le Sirenuse brand. Specifically, we are increasing the accuracy and relevance of the artificial intelligence learning models that convert insight obtained from data analysis and social media analytics. 



We look forward to demonstrating the tool to you next month. 


Thank you,


Kimia Mavon, Francesca Morini, Karan Rajesh Motwani, Moreno Vendra
